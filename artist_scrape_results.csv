He was born in Philadelphia, the only child of James and Mary (Clark) Benbridge. When he was seven years old, his mother, who had been left a widow, was married to Thomas Gordon, a wealthy Scot. The boy\'s artistic talent was encouraged. He made decorative designs for his stepfather\'s drawing-room which were much admired. When he was fourteen years old he may have watched John Wollaston paint Gordon\'s portrait. It has been plausibly argued[2] that young Benbridge had instruction from Wollaston, since his earliest known portrait, that of his half-sister Rebecca Gordon, ""seems to hark back to Wollaston."" When he was 21, Benbridge was sent to Italy, where he studied with Pompeo Batoni and Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1769, on commission from James Boswell, biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, he made a portrait of Pasquale Paoli in Corsica which he took to London. It was exhibited (1769) at the Free Society of Artists, and from it three mezzotints were scraped and published with the artist\'s name signed ""Bembridge."" Like other young Americans he was encouraged by Benjamin West. He wrote, on December 7, 1769, to his stepfather: ""Upon my arrival I waited upon Mr. West who received me with a sort of brotherly affection, as did my cousin, Mrs. West."" Impelled, apparently, by a longing to rejoin his family, he left England in 1770, bearing from West the following note of recommendation to Francis Hopkinson: ""By Mr. Benbridge you will receive these few lines. You will find him an Ingenous artist and an agreeable Companion. His merit in the art must procure him great incouragement and much esteem.

The primary art historical debate centered on Duncanson concerns the role that contemporary racial issues played in his work. Some art historians, like Joseph D.

The presence of his masterpiece, the Portinari Triptych in Florence, from 1483 onwards played a role in the development of realism and the use of colour in Italian Renaissance art.[1]\n']"

""El Greco"" was a nickname,[a][b] a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan.\n', 'a. ^  Theotokópoulos acquired the name ""El Greco"" in Italy, where the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of origin was a common practice. The curious form of the article (El) may be from the Venetian dialect or more likely from the Spanish, though in Spanish his name would be ""El Griego"".[4] The Cretan master was generally known in Italy and Spain as Dominico Greco, and was called only after his death El Greco (Spanish pronunciation:\xa0[el greˈko]).[66]\n', 'b. ^  According to a contemporary, El Greco acquired his name, not only for his place of origin, but also for the sublimity of his art: ""Out of the great esteem he was held in he was called the Greek (il Greco)"" (comment of Giulio Cesare Mancini about El Greco in his Chronicles, which were written a few years after El Greco\'s death).[116]\n', ""c. ^  There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace. Most researchers and scholars give Candia as his birthplace.[117] Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old Fodele was (the village later changed location because of pirate raids).[46] Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele.[118]\n"", 'd. ^  This document comes from the notarial archives of Candia and was published in 1962.[119] Menegos is the Venetian dialect form of Doménicos, and Sgourafos (σγουράφος=ζωγράφος) is a Greek term for painter.[66]\n', 'e. ^  The arguments of these Catholic sources are based on the lack of Orthodox archival baptismal records on Crete and on a relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites during El Greco\'s youth.[120] Based on the assessment that his art reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain, and on a reference in his last will and testament, where he described himself as a ""devout Catholic"", some scholars assume that El Greco was part of the vibrant Catholic Cretan minority or that he converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism before leaving the island.[121]\n', 'f. ^  According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On 26 December 1566 El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a ""panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background"" (""un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato"") in a lottery.[66] The Byzantine icon by young Doménicos depicting the Passion of Christ, painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on 27 December 1566 in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period.[122] Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after 27 December 1566.[123] In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that El Greco left Crete in 1567.[113] According to other archival material—drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan cartographer—he was in Venice by 1568.[122]\n', 'g. ^  Mancini reports that El Greco said to the Pope that if the whole work was demolished he himself would do it in a decent manner and with seemliness.[124]\n', 'h. ^  Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was 62,000.[34]\n', 'i. ^ El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on 18 June 1603. He agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict. He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the appraisers.[125] The brotherhood took advantage of this act of good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement.[126] Finally, El Greco assigned his legal representation to Preboste and a friend of him, Francisco Ximénez Montero, and accepted a payment of 2,093 ducats.[127]\n', 'j. ^ Doña Jerónima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco, and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment.[4]\n', 'k. ^  The myth of El Greco\'s madness came in two versions. On the one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity.[128] On the other hand, the public and the critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would retain the image of El Greco as a ""mad painter"" and, therefore, his ""maddest"" paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his ""madness"".[79]\n', 'l. ^  This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German psychologist David Kuntz.[129] Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate.[130] Stuart Anstis, Professor at the University of California (Department of Psychology), concludes that ""even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom.""[131] According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, ""astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce"".[132]\n']"

Turner, Odilon Redon, Pierre Bonnard and Mark Rothko, as well as the light of her native California.[2][8] Art & Antiques described her approach as ""chromatic expressionism"" in which color is ""her undisputed protagonist"";[8] Peter Frank observed, ""The dialectic between color and form has always inflected, even impelled"" Burton\'s painting, with color the more omnipresent element, and form the more persistent.[12] Art historian William C. Agee wrote, ""The domains she explores […] meet, intersect, fuse, and then disappear, like apparitions, in liquid pools of mist and color.

Later episodes depict D.J. as having a close, brother-like friendship with Becky\'s husband Mark.  He is also shown to develop an interest in filmmaking: he repeatedly asks Darlene if he can videotape her giving birth. He was one of the only characters that wasn\'t changed in the final episode of Season 9, which has since been ret-conned out of existence.\n', 'Mark Healy is played by Glenn Quinn. Mark dates and later elopes with Becky, much to the Conners\' consternation. Despite Mark\'s tough-guy image and rebel persona, he is rarely seen to engage in criminal activity. Roseanne initially had a strong dislike for Mark because of his condescending attitude toward her. Dan initially dislikes Mark as well; Mark\'s choice to ride a British Triumph motorcycle rather than an American Harley-Davidson causes particular tension. However, Dan soon respects Mark\'s work ethic and hires him as a mechanic, both at his bike shop and his truck-inspection office. Mark\'s personality changes drastically over the course of the series — he starts off as a rebellious delinquent but ultimately proves himself to be a caring and responsible (though comedically dull-witted) husband and brother. Roseanne and the rest of the family eventually grow to love Mark, though they still get amusement out of insulting him. Mark has a younger brother, David, who dates (and later marries) Darlene. He also has two much younger sisters, Lisa and Nikki, who appear briefly in the Season 5 episode ""No Place Like Home for The Holidays"".\n', 'Kevin ""David"" Maurice Healy is played by Johnny Galecki. David is Mark\'s younger brother. He first appeared in ""The Bowling Show"" (episode 4.14). Whereas Mark acted like a rebellious delinquent at first, David is friendlier to the Conners.  He\'s shy, polite, thoughtful, sensitive, soft-spoken, artistic, and intelligent. He has a relationship with Darlene and collaborates with her by illustrating graphic novels that she writes, being the submissive one in the relationship. His manner is endearing to the Conners, who think of him as part of the family and jokingly refer to him as being more welcome than Darlene. He moves in with the Conners after Roseanne, herself a victim of child abuse, sees how abusive David\'s mother is to him. David and Darlene break up three times throughout the course of the show, each for a longer period of time than the last; they always end up back together. Eventually, David impregnates Darlene and they decide to marry. In the series finale, Roseanne reveals that David had actually been dating Becky in ""real life"", and that Roseanne simply wrote his relationship as being with Darlene because she felt it made more sense. That series finale is retconned for season 10, where it is revealed that David and Darlene have separated and David has been away traveling and doing volunteer work, leaving Darlene to care alone for their two children, Harris and Mark. He later visits Darlene, telling her he is moving back into town to settle down with another woman and asks her for a divorce. After they end up sleeping together, they both consider getting back together until Roseanne informs Darlene that it wouldn\'t be good for their kids, who resent David for not being there for them. They both agree to move forward with the divorce and on Dan\'s urging, David agrees to get his act together and proceed with the move before he can see the kids again.\n', 'Harris Conner-Healy is portrayed by Emma Kenney. She was born premature and was not expected to survive. Darlene names her Harris Conner Healy as a tribute to all of the strong women her family (""Harris"" is Roseanne\'s maiden name) in the hopes that she\'d have the same strength to survive. \n', ""Mark Conner-Healy is portrayed by Ames McNamara. The younger of Darlene's two children, Mark is a 10-year-old boy with a strong interest in fashion. His interest in things traditionally feminine, such as wearing makeup and skirts, is somewhat worrisome to his grandparents, with Roseanne worried that Mark will be bullied by his narrow-minded peers and Dan feeling that he needs to persuade the youngster to take on more masculine traits. Noticing a classmate make a snide comment to Mark on his first day at school in Lanford, Roseanne threatens his classmates by telling them she's a witch, while Dan gives Mark a pocket knife, which ultimately results in him being called to the principal's office and sent home from school for the day, much to Darlene's chagrin. Despite Roseanne and Dan's concerns, they express support and love for him. Mark is named for his deceased uncle, Mark Healy.\n"", ""Mary Conner is portrayed by Jayden Rey. Mary is D.J. and Geena's daughter. Mary in named for her deceased great-great-grandmother, Nana Mary.\n"", ""Geena Williams-Conner is portrayed by Maya Lynne Robinson (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly in season 7 and Xosha Roquemore in season 10). The wife of D.J. and mother of Mary; she is, like D.J., a military veteran.\n"", ""Nancy Lynn Bartlett is played by Sandra Bernhard. Nancy is a part owner of the Lanford Lunch Box.  She is married to Arnie but later comes out as a lesbian after he leaves her, then admits to being bisexual.  She frequently is seen dating women; her first girlfriend Marla is played by Morgan Fairchild.  Nancy is never ashamed of her promiscuity, nor does she ever show any self-consciousness of her unusual behavior.  In fact, she is one of the most self-confident characters in the series, often even more than Roseanne.  Her tendency toward self-absorption seems to only be quelled while dating a woman or being around Jackie.  Nancy turns out to be a loyal and good friend to both Roseanne and Jackie throughout the series, although she doesn't hesitate to reprimand them for their selfishness and cruelty when they treat their mother, Bev, so harshly that Bev ends up crying about it for days afterward, while Nancy supports her.\n"", ""Leon Carp is played by Martin Mull. Leon, originally as Roseanne's boss at Rodbell's Luncheonette and later as her business partner in The Lanford Lunchbox, he is portrayed as a foe to Roseanne; although they have a contentious relationship at times, Leon gradually becomes a close friend of the Conners, ultimately becoming an extended family member of sorts. As a gay man, he is occasionally seen dating many men and having romantic troubles; however, he later marries his life partner Scott (Fred Willard) in a very public ceremony. In the ninth season, they visit the Conner residence bearing gifts for Darlene and David's new baby, Harris, proclaiming themselves as the infant's Aunt Scott and Aunt Leon. Near the end of the episode, they announce their plans to adopt a little girl. Leon's role in the series expands significantly in the eighth and ninth seasons, as he is featured in more episodes. He is especially upset when Roseanne wins the lottery, but Roseanne and Jackie end up relinquishing control of the restaurant to Leon and Nancy. Leon is a Republican, and holds George Bush in high regard. He also is shown throughout the series' run to be a fan of Liza Minnelli, as well as Broadway musicals.\n"", ""Crystal Anderson-Conner is played by Natalie West. Crystal is a close friend of Roseanne, having gone to high school with her and Jackie and later working together with them at Wellman Plastics. A mild-mannered and good-hearted woman, Crystal's kindness is often taken advantage of, even by Roseanne at times. Though Crystal is not oblivious to others using her, she seldom asserts herself, fearing she might lose others' favor or be perceived as unladylike.\n"", 'Ed Conner is played by Ned Beatty. Ed is Dan\'s father, a charming traveling salesman who always brings presents for the grandchildren. Dan has a troubled history with his father, and Roseanne tries to keep the peace between the two. The family likes Ed, but Dan grew up feeling neglected with Ed seldom being home and his mother\'s mental illness (e.g., when Dan questions Ed dating Crystal, Ed makes a rude crack about Dan being ""interested"" in Crystal). It usually takes little to no time for Dan to become annoyed by his father\'s presence. All this was unknown to Dan until Crystal revealed it to Roseanne. Ed hoped to provide Dan with at least one stable parent as he would often be gone on sales trips during Dan\'s adolescence. He wants to learn from his past actions and be a better father and husband. He loves his son despite their troubled relationship, and also loves the rest of his family. He marries Crystal and has two children with her (Ed Jr. and Angela), who are significantly younger than their half-brother, Dan.\n', ""Jerry Garcia Conner is played by Cole Roberts and Morgan Roberts. Jerry is the youngest of Roseanne and Dan's children, born in 1995 when the two are in their forties. Jerry's conception presented a real struggle for Roseanne and Dan, who previously had never experienced issues with their fertility. He was named for musician Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who died of a heart attack while Roseanne was pregnant and of whom she and Dan were fans. Because he was so young, Jerry didn't play a large role in the series' initial run. Jerry did not appear in Season 10, nor has he appeared on The Conners . His absence is explained by Roseanne as him being on a fishing boat in Alaska. After her demise, there is still no\nmention of his whereabouts.\n"", ""Fred is played by Michael O'Keefe. Fred is a mechanic who works at the garage with Dan and is introduced to Jackie, leading to a one-night stand, accidental impregnation, and subsequent marriage. After much encouragement Jackie eventually warms up and faces the fact that Fred is the father of her child and therefore a part of their lives. At first Fred assumes that Jackie is just putting him off lightly because he fails to understand that she had a previous abusive relationship in addition to her dysfunctional childhood. Being very conventional, Fred is shocked by the Conners' and Harris' unconventional ways and cannot understand the inner workings of Jackie's family. This leads to the dissolution of Jackie and Fred's marriage. Despite their attempts to make the marriage work, Jackie and Fred break up when they realize they have little in common.\n"", 'Andy Harris is Jackie and Fred\'s son, born in 1994 on the episode ""Labor Day"". Jackie breastfeeds Andy at the altar while marrying Fred (""Altar Egos""). Andy was the ringbearer in Darlene and David\'s wedding (""The Wedding""). Jackie occasionally dressed him up in outfits Fred deemed to be feminine. DJ made it a point to spend time with Andy because DJ didn\'t have any male siblings at the time, not until his brother Jerry came along a year later. Andy and Jerry are cousins and, as babies, took naps together in the same crib.\n', 'Beverly Lorraine ""Bev"" Harris is played by Estelle Parsons. Beverly is the mother of Roseanne and Jackie, the wife of Al, and the daughter of Nana Mary. She has a half-sister named Sonya. Overbearing and shrill, she\'s avoided by all of her family members. She nags them with her shockingly whiny voice, often with good intentions but presenting them in the wrong way. The family (especially Jackie) tries to avoid spending any time with Bev, as she is quick to inadvertently criticize how people live their lives. After going back and forth playing tricks on each other in one Halloween episode, Roseanne ultimately gets the upper hand by having a fake phone conversation with Bev in front of Dan where she agrees to let her mother stay for three weeks. She is very traditional and conservative, as opposed to her daughters\' more liberal and feminist philosophies. She proves herself generous with the wealth she receives from her husband\'s alimony, constantly giving financial gifts to the family to bail them out. She even provides the seed money for the Lanford Lunch Box and insists on staying on as a partner, but is later forced out because Roseanne and Jackie do not want to work with her. As revenge, she sells her share of the restaurant to Roseanne\'s ex-boss and rival, Leon Carp, effectively making him their new partner. During the show\'s final season, she comes out as a lesbian (according to one of Roseanne\'s fictional twists on her family, along with winning the lottery), this is revealed in the finale in which Roseanne states that her mother is not a lesbian but that her sister is; she just thought it\'d be interesting to put a radical twist on the character of her mother, who lived her life according to her husband\'s rules, and because she wished her mother had a better sense of herself as a woman. Bev\'s relationship with her own mother is very similar to the one her daughters have with her.\n', 'Nana Mary is played by Shelley Winters. Nana Mary is Beverly\'s mother and Roseanne and Jackie\'s grandmother, and first appears at a family barbecue in season three. She has another daughter named Sonya. She makes several appearances from season three onward, mostly during family occasions. She is a brash but caring, free-spirited, outspoken, lovable retiree who gambles with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Unlike Bev, she is popular with the family. She also disagrees with Bev on certain situations, such as siding with Jackie when Bev tries to get her to marry Fred, and revealing that she had two abortions, upsetting Bev who is against the idea. She outsmarts Bev and drives her crazy, much to the amusement of Roseanne and Jackie, who usually endure the same torment from Bev. Her character is often a comic relief for the family, as well as offering a balance between Roseanne and Jackie\'s relationship with their mother, and Bev\'s relationship with Nana Mary. She was promiscuous in her younger days and claims to have dated Pablo Picasso and Louis Armstrong. Mary had Bev with another man before marrying her deceased husband Marvin. She tells Bev she was very young when she was born, and doesn\'t know who the father is, avoiding the subject whenever Bev brings it up. She is a big fan of a local radio call-in show that revolves around sex: ""If I don\'t call, they worry,"" she claims. Nana Mary\'s last appearance is midway through season nine, in which she finally has a heart-to-heart with Bev, thus closing the story on their relationship. Despite her absence, Mary appears at other family occasions, including the birth of her great-great-granddaughter. In the reboot and spinoff, D.J. and Geena\'s daughter is named for Nana Mary, who has since died.\n', 'Arnold Shep ""Arnie"" Thomas is played by Tom Arnold. Arnie is the overweight, hot-tempered but jovial friend of Dan. Originally, he was written as a relative stranger to both Roseanne and Jackie, although this was later retconned, and he was subsequently written as having gone to high school with them. He frequently cheats on the women he dates and is very ill-mannered. However, Arnie always tries to be a good friend to Dan. He marries Nancy but leaves her, claiming to be abducted by aliens (later played upon in the fourth-season finale\'s end-credit sketch, where he is seen conversing with aliens on a spaceship). Before he and Nancy are engaged, he has a one-night stand with a drunk Jackie. Arnie is often seen wearing a yellow University of Iowa sweatshirt (Tom Arnold attended the University of Iowa in real life). He is last seen in season 5, where he unsuccessfully tries to win Nancy back, even after finding out that she is a lesbian. Tom Arnold appears in the ending credits of a later episode, but is now playing Jackie Thomas (in his role on The Jackie Thomas Show), and none of the characters seem to recognize him.\n']"

Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, Du ""Cubisme"", 1912. Gleizes was a founding member of the Section d\'Or group of artists. He was also a member of Der Sturm, and his many theoretical writings were originally most appreciated in Germany, where especially at the Bauhaus his ideas were given thoughtful consideration. Gleizes spent four crucial years in New York, and played an important role in making America aware of modern art. He was a member of the Society of Independent Artists, founder of the Ernest-Renan Association, and both a founder and participant in the Abbaye de Créteil.[1] Gleizes exhibited regularly at Léonce Rosenberg’s Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris; he was also a founder, organizer and director of Abstraction-Création. From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s much of his energy went into writing, e.g., La Peinture et ses lois (Paris, 1923), Vers une conscience plastique: La Forme et l’histoire (Paris, 1932) and Homocentrisme (Sablons, 1937).[2]\n', 'The approach:\nGleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation (p.\xa031); Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste (p.\xa042); The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse] (p.\xa043); The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact (p.\xa056); Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion (p.\xa059); The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting (p.\xa022).[27][30]\n', 'Defining the laws:\nRhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.\xa035, 38, 51). This mechanism is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian Pierre Alibert\xa0[fr], the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.[27][29]\n', 'Schematic illustrations:\n']"

Smith, who has been described as personifying white Rhodesia, remains a highly controversial figure—supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa,[5] while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused the deaths of thousands and contributed to Zimbabwe's later crises.\n"", 'Footnotes\n', 'References\n', 'Newspaper and journal articles\n', 'Online sources\n', 'Bibliography\n']"
